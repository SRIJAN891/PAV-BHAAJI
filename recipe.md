In the streets and in restaurants, pav bhaji is made on a large flat tawa (griddle). At home you can make pav bhaji in a kadai or in a frying pan.

Pav bhaji has a bright orangish red color. When you make pav bhaji at home, you won’t get the color that you typically see in hotels and restaurants. Some street vendors also add artificial red color.

As far as possible avoid the use of artificial food colors and use natural colors instead. So to get the red color in pav bhaji, use Kashmiri red chilli powder or deghi mirch.

Alternatively you can even make red chili paste. Soak 2 to 3 Kashmiri red chilies (seeds removed) in hot water for 30 minutes, then make a fine paste and add to the pav bhaji.

Tips
Tips
Which veggies to add:The vegetables that are usually added to pav bhaji are cauliflower, potatoes, carrots, peas, capsicum and french beans. In the pav bhaji that one gets in the streets of Mumbai, carrots are usually not added. But when you make at home, you can add carrots.
Cooking veggies: In the recipe I have used a pressure cooker for cooking the vegetables. You can also steam or cook them in a pan or in the Instant Pot.
Taste: Depending on the quantity of these vegetables, the final taste and color of the pav bhaji will be different. Example, if you add more carrots, the pav bhaji will have a mild sweeter taste. You can also just make pav bhaji with any of these veggie combinations. However, do add capsicum (green bell pepper) as it gives a really good taste in pav bhaji.
Spicing: The spice powders can be easily adjusted to suit your taste.
Vegan option: If you don’t want to add butter, then you can also make the pav bhaji with a neutral tasting oil or a vegan butter.
Substitute for Pav bhaji masala: If you don’t have pav bhaji masala, then add garam masala. I have made pav bhaji with garam masala only and nobody could tell the difference. In this scenario, also add some dry mango powder (amchur) to get that slightly sour taste. The quantity to add is 2 teaspoons garam masala with 1 teaspoon amchur (dry mango powder).
Pav Bhaji Masala: Use good quality pav bhaji masala or make it at home.

pav bhaji recipe
How is pav bhaji served
Pav bhaji can be had as a meal during lunch or dinner. You could also have it as an evening snack.




The vegetable gravy or bhaji is served with pav. Pav or pao are soft bread rolls. Cubes of butter are also topped on the hot steaming bhaji while serving.

A few coriander leaves are added as a garnish. As a side accompaniment, chopped onions and lemon wedges are also served.

The lemon juice has to be drizzled on the pav bhaji and then mixed and eaten with the pav.

For the pav you can either make them at home or buy from a good bakery. I usually make Pav a day before when we plan to have pav bhaji or Misal Pav.

Pav bhaji is one of the most popular Mumbai street food. Whenever we would go to Juhu beach, pav bhaji was one snack we would always have.

I have fond memories of having pav bhaji and other Mumbai street food snacks In my childhood at Juhu beach in Mumbai.
