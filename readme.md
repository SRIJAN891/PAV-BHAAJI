What is Pav Bhaji
Pav bhaji is an iconic dish from Mumbai and hugely popular all over India. Pav means bread rolls.

Bhaji is the marathi word for vegetables or a vegetable based dish (dry or gravy). Since both the bhaji (vegetable gravy) and pav are served together, hence the name ‘Pav bhaji‘

Pav bhaji is basically a mix of mashed & spiced vegetables in a gravy. A special spice blend ‘Pav Bhaji Masala‘ is used to make pav bhaji.

Pav bhaji masala powder is easily available in Indian stores and can be easily made at home too. Though homemade spice blends are always good, but you can make pav bhaji with your favorite brand of pav bhaji masala.

Pav bhaji originated in Mumbai as a quick lunch option for textile mill workers. Gradually this dish becomes so popular that now it is served as street food as well as in restaurants in Mumbai and the rest of India.
